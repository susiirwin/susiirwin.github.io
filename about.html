<p>I am a current student at the <a href="https://www.turing.io/" target="_blank">Turing School of Software and Design</a> in Denver, Colorado. I am the mother to an incredible 2 year old, whom I speak about way to often as well as the wife to an amazing husband. I am an aspiring Rubyist and Backend Web Developer. In a former life, I was a SharePoint Business Analyst and Solutions Specialist. I dabble in Bluegrass Fiddling but my training was in classical Violin. I cannot cook much outside of breakfast treats, but I make a mean cup of coffee and can bake really well. I can knit and crochet (you can find me on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/people/firepoet" target=_blank>Ravelry</a>) and can sew things that don't need to have perfectly straight hems.</p>
