<h1>Starting with a Breath</h1>
<p>August 11, 2016</p>
<p>I knew going into this who Turing thing was going to be a giant life changer. I assumed, based on some blogs I had read and some folks I had spoken to, that this was going to be a whirlwind of firehoses and obscenely long days. I <i>thought</i> I knew what I was getting into with Turing. After 7 weeks, I am not sure that I was all that aware, but I would not change it for the world.</p>

<p> Is it possible to have a lessons learned after only 1 module of the program? Is it too soon to have a "if-I-did-it-all-over-again-I-would-change" list? Considering that we are focusing on a growth mindset as we venture into this whole new world of programming, I think it is exactly what we <em>should</em> be doing.</p>

<h3>I Need to Breathe</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, this was the easiest thing for me to forget in my first 6 weeks at Turing. Yup, I simply forgot to breathe. A lot. I would get stressed out, over tired, confused, and frustrated and then, well, I just forgot to breathe. You would think this would be the simplest idea to keeo in one's mind, but you would be terribly and sadly mistaken. One thing Jeff tells us constantly is to take care of ourselves. He says to get rest, take a walk, get some air. Jorge tells us to call our Moms. We laugh at these and take them as jokes or silly anecdotes to keep us relaxed, but these tips... these bits of life advice... they are crucial and often forgotten. So, I started breathing. Everyday on my bus ride to school I take 10 minutes and fall into a guided meditation. And. I. Breathe.</p>

<h3>I Need to Believe in Myself</h3>
<p> The reality of this program is that we are all new to programming. Well, most of us are new to programming - there are a few here and there who have had more exposure than some of us. But, I digress. For the most part - we are newbs and newbs need time to acclimate. Everything feels like a victory in the first 6 weeks because for all intents and purposes - it is. You are accomplishing feats you could not accomplish 24 hours prior to that moment. Case in point: One night I was working on getting my toddler to sleep. He was too awake and I needed to go study. I decided that I should study outloud to him. Did you follow that? I needed to review how a Class was created in Ruby. So I spoke it all out to my son until his eyes started to close and he drifted off to sleep. Before that grand lecture of Class creation momentously occured, I had merely learned about classes about 12 hours prior. Yet, I could sit in the glider in his room, rock him gently back and forth, and spew forth all that I had learned that day. I didn't know any of that the day before. I know more now than I did 6 weeks ago. And when Mod 2 starts next week, I will continue to learn. And that... that is just amazing to me.</p>
